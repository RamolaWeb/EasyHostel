# EasyHostel
This project aims to improve and simplify attendance recording and authentication of students
while entering their Hostel mess that the data collected through our device can be used to
calculate student's mess bill in real time and provide a common platform to both students and
mess staffs to address issues related to quality, quantity of food and to also avoid miscalculation
of mess bills.<br/>
Our device uses fingerprint sensor to authenticate students and their details like roll no. will be
shown on a LCD Display.The data collected from this device is uploaded to cloud through
NodeMCU ESP8266 which can be analyzed through a website developed by us. The website
also provides various features like registering new student, searching students attendance
history.<br/>
The proposed project enables self accounting of mess bill which will lead to increase
transparency of mess account advance and it will also provide tool for estimating food wastage
in mess by analyzing eating habits of students.<br/>
Future Scope our project are:<br/>
● To analyse the food wastage in the hostel mess by calculating the no. of attendance in
the given period<br/>
● To predict the quantity of the raw material to be used<br/>
● To provide real time feedback of the food to mess attendant and Mess secretary<br/>
